        <h1>Economic Equality</h1>
        <h2>What is ecnomic Inequality?</h2>
        <p>Economic inequality refers to the unequal distribution of income, wealth, and opportunities within different groups of a society. 
            Economic equality is a concern in almost all countries around the world and people all over the world get trapped in poverty with little opportunity to climb up the social ladder for a better life. A lot of people assume being born in poverty means you will have to stay in poverty for your whole life. 
            Education, at all levels, enhancing skills, and training policies can be used alongside social assistance programs to help people out of poverty and to reduce inequality. It is sad to see that many countries struggle with economic inequality and how many families are stuck with little opportunity. </p>

        <h3>Where is Income ineuqality more common?</h3>
        <p>Income inequality is found to be more common in South Africa as well as Nambia. How people measure the statistical dispersion is with what they call the Gini index which is intended to represent the inequality within a nation.
            The countries South Africa and Nambia are constinatly ranked among the countries with the highest levels of economic inequality worldwide. South Africa is often cited as having the most unequal distrubution of income, often with a Gini score of around 59
            , while zambia is frequently mentioned in lists of countries with high ineuqality with a Gini index of 70. The reason why southern Africa face ecnomic inequality more than other countries is because of the legacy of colonialism and apartheid, uneuqal access to resources, and their limited opportunites in souther Africa. Those factors have created a persistent gap between the wealthy and the poor, with facots like race, location, and education playing a major role. The historical systems of racial segregation and discrimination under apartheid and colonim has created lasting inqualities in wealth, income, and the opportunity to live a better stable life. It is sad how because of hsitory some countries have to face problems like economic inequality when it isn't their fault they can't get better and bigger opportunities.     </p>
