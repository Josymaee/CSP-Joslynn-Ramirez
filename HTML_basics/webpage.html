    <h1>Economic Equality</h1>

    <h2>What is Economic Inequality?</h2>
    <p>
      Economic inequality refers to the unequal distribution of income, wealth,
      and opportunities within different groups of a society. Economic equality
      is a concern in almost all countries around the world, and people all
      over the world get trapped in poverty with little opportunity to climb up
      the social ladder for a better life. A lot of people assume being born in
      poverty means you will have to stay in poverty for your whole life.
      Education at all levels, enhancing skills, and training policies can be
      used alongside social assistance programs to help people out of poverty
      and reduce inequality. It is sad to see that many countries struggle with
      economic inequality and how many families are stuck with little
      opportunity.

      <h3>Where is Income Inequality More Common?</h3>
      <p>
        Income inequality is found to be more common in South Africa as well as
        Namibia. People measure the statistical dispersion using what they call
        the Gini index, which is intended to represent the inequality within a
        nation. South Africa and Namibia are constantly ranked among the
        countries with the highest levels of economic inequality worldwide.
        South Africa is often cited as having the most unequal distribution of
        income, often with a Gini score of around 59, while Zambia is
        frequently mentioned in lists of countries with high inequality with a
        Gini index of 70. The reason why Southern Africa faces economic
        inequality more than other regions is because of the legacy of
        colonialism and apartheid, unequal access to resources, and limited
        opportunities in Southern Africa. These factors have created a
        persistent gap between the wealthy and the poor, with race, location,
        and education playing major roles. The historical systems of racial
        segregation and discrimination under apartheid and colonialism have
        created lasting inequalities in wealth, income, and the opportunity to
        live a better, stable life. It is sad how, because of history, some
        countries have to face problems like economic inequality when it isn't
        their fault they can't access better and bigger opportunities.
