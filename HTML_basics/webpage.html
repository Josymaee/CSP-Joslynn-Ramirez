        <h2>What is ecnomic Inequality?</h2>
        <p>Economic inequality refers to the unequal distribution of income, wealth, and opportunities within different groups of a society. Economic equality is a concern in almost all countries around the world and people all over the world get trapped in poverty with little opportunity to climb up the social ladder for a better life. A lot of people assume being born in poverty means you will have to stay in poverty for your whole life. Education, at all levels, enhancing skills, and training policies can be used alongside social assistance programs to help people out of poverty and to reduce inequality.</p>
