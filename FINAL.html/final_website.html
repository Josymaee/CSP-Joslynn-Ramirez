      <h3>What Should You Know Before Coming?</h3>
      <p>
        Before visiting Capitol Reef, it’s important to know that the park is quite large and remote, so cell phone service can be limited. Make sure to bring plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months, as temperatures can soar above 100°F (38°C). The park is open year-round, but some roads and trails may be closed in winter due to snow. There are no gas stations inside the park, so fuel up beforehand. Visitors should also respect the fragile desert environment by staying on marked trails and not disturbing wildlife or historic sites. Camping is available, but reservations are recommended during busy seasons. Finally, check the National Park Service website for any alerts or special events before your trip.
