        <p>The park is known for its colorful canyons, towering cliffs, domes, and natural bridges. One of its most distinctive features is the Waterpocket Fold, a nearly 100-mile-long wrinkle in the Earth’s crust that was formed millions of years ago. Early settlers named the area “Capitol Reef” because the white Navajo Sandstone domes looked like Capitol building domes, and the rocky ridges reminded them of ocean reefs that were difficult to cross. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/capitol-dome.htm" target="_blank">Learn more about the Capital Dome.</a></p>
